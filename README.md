# notes-css

Notes are found throughout styling sheets.

Stands for Cascading stylesheets
* Its a styling language, not a programming language.
* For layout and design.
* Most commonly used with HTML.

Three ways to add CSS

- Inline: Adding a style attribute to the html tag (not what you want to do) 

- Internal css:  Using <style> tags within the head of the HTML page. This is better, because it does separate the style from presentation.  

- External: linking a style sheet to the html file (best option) 

html hacks (sublime):
- `lorem` then tab gives you some filler text 
- `<element` then tab gives you closing element 


There are web safe fonts (I like Tahoma)

Class vs Id: There are not “real” differences between them. You do, however, want to think do want to think of ids as something that is unique, used once.  Classes are typically re-used.
